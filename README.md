### Project Overview
---

Herein lies a report written in fulfillment of a data analysis internship program hosted by HNG. This is a 'first glance' technical report aimed at developing skills at quickly interpreting data and the communication of said data.
HNG is a company with a mission - working with the very best techies to help enhance their skills through an internship program networking. HNG also work with clients to find them the best technical talent across the globe.
HNG Internship is a fast-paced bootcamp for learning digital skills which focuses on advanced learners and those with some pre-knowledge helping them get into shape for job offers. Its bootcamp is designed for interns to work in teams to build apps and solve problems. Additional information can be accessed at [internship](https://hng.tech/internship). The internship is free but adds a premium feature which can be accessed at [premium](https://hng.tech/premium).


### Task
---

It includes the selection of a dataset (from a list of provided datasets), its review and the identification of insights at a first glance.

### Tools used
---

Excel (Data cleaning) 
Tableau (Visualization)

### Dataset information
---

The dataset selected is a Retail sales data for a company into the manufacture of vehicles for a period of 3years ranging from June 2003 to May 2005. The dataset consists of a single csv file with 2823 rows, 22 categorical and 3 numerical columns. A copy of the dataset can be found [here](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fc%2Ftitanic%2Fdata)

### Analysis
---

Data inconsistencies

As with most datasets, the retail sales dataset consists of some sort of inconsistencies that could skew the accuracy and validity of any analysis carried out. It is important to note that effective data analysis includes the use of 'clean' data for effective application to solving business problems.

Major inconsistencies found and possible ways of resolving such is highlighted as follows
1. Majority of the column headings need to be adequately spaced for easier readability.
2. The column MSRP has no clear definition on what information it holds. Clarification from the data source might be required else analysis might exclude this variable.
3. The sales column has inaccurate figures as the sales column is generated by the product of the unit price and quantity purchased. Sales figure existing in the dataset are erroneous for products with a unit price of '100'. A new column can be generated to correct this error by taking the product of the price and quantity.
4. Time for order date should be removed as it's the same for all rows.
5. Format for telephone numbers are inconsistent. Correction could be made to address such.
6. State column has some blanks. This can easily be inputted using information from the corresponding city and country column.
7. The territory column has 'Japan' listed as one of its attributes. Japan is a country and not a territory. All rows with such should be corrected. Japan belongs to the Asia-Pacific (APAC) territory.


A brief insight to analysis carried out and visualized for the objectives stated below are offered
Objectives
1. Determine what Sales/Revenue trend is over time.
2. Identify Top (5) customers by deal size.
3. Identify the Territory with the biggest sales figure.

### Insights
---

From the brief analysis conducted, it's obvious that the 4th quarter of the year is the peak periods for orders and sales.
The medium deal size category contributes the largest percentage of revenue. Also, Euro shipping channels and Mini gifts distributors ltd remain the top 2 customer across all deal size.
The APAC territory rakes in more revenue and have made the largest product order till date, followed by the North American territory. Factors contributing to these figures have not yet been considered as the analysis suggests only a first glance brief.

### Conclusion

After careful consideration, it was observed that the dataset can be used for a varying number of analysis which includes but not limited to

1. Sales analysis- identify sales trend (number of orders made with its corresponding revenue) by a number of variables such as the product line, time, territory/region etc
2. Customer analysis- identify the demographics of existing customers (country, state,city) while highlighting top and bottom customers as well as. deal size
3. Order analysis- identify the variation in order status and the progressing of these orders over time.
